            Am        G             F        C
There was a camp town man, used to plow and sing
Am                G            F          C
And he loved that mule and the mule loved him
         Am      G          F          C
When the day got long as it does about now
Am           G              F     C
I'd hear him singing to his muley cow

C    Csus2    C    Csus 
Calling, "Come on my sweet old girl,
C    Csus2    C    Csus 
I'd bet the whole damn world, that
C           Dm      C/E                   G    Gsus    G
we're gonna make it yet to the end of the road"


        Am        G            F       C  
Singing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Am        G            F       C          
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Bessie
Am         G           F    G          C    Cmaj7
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more

            Am       G      F        C  
Said it's a mean old world, heavy in need
Am          G              F          C   
That big machine is just a picking up speed
          Am         G                F          C  
They were supping on tears, they were supping on wine
Am            G             F         C  
We all get to heaven in our own sweet time

C    Csus2    C    Csus 
So come all you Asheville boys
C    Csus2    C    Csus 
'n turn up your old-time noise
    C                 Dm    C/E                       G  Gsus  G
'n kick 'til the dust comes up from the cracks in the floor

        Am        G            F       C           
Singing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, brother
Am        G            F       C
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Am        G            F       G      C
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more

        Am       G               F       C
But the camptown man, he doesn't plow no more
Am         G                   F         C   
I seen him walking down to the superette store
         Am        G            F           C  
Guess he lost that knack and he forgot that song
Am          G               F        C  
Woke up one morning and the mule was gone


C  Csus2  C  Csus 
So come all you ragtime kings,
C  Csus2  C  Csus 
'n come on you dogs and sing
C              Dm        C/E                G  Gsus  G
'n pick up the dusty old horn and give it a blow

        Am        G            F       C
Playing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, honey
Am        G            F       C         
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, sugar
Am        G            F       G       C
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more
